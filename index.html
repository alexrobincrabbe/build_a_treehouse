                <h2>Types of Treehouses</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing to consider when building a treehouse, is the scope and function.
                    A lot depends on the tree, and how much floor area you can realistically support.
                    The most basic type is a floor only, which is appropriate if you only want a childrens
                    playhouse. Depending on the height, you will need to consider a railing, and whether a Ladder
                    or stairs with a railing are necessary.
                    If you are ambitious, you might want to consider building a walls and a roof, which will
                    dramatically
                    increase the work involved. Then adding windows and door if you want to creat a guest house. All of
                    these steps involve exponentially more money and time.

                    <h2>The Floor</h2>
                    <p>
                        The exact size and dimensions of the platform will depend on the tree that you are building
                        the house in. While typical treehouse designs tend to use <a
                            href="gallery.html#support">supports at
                            45
                            degrees</a>
                        from the tree trunk, I used an unconventional design:
                        I cut of several trunks from a willow tree, and used the stumps as the support for my platform.
                        I used the the cut offtrunks as <a href="gallery.html#support2">pillars</a> to support the
                        extended balcony.
                        If you are building a floor without a roof, then you should use decking and leave spaces between
                        the
                        boards for water to drain. For the indoor flooring I used tongue and groove boards.
                        If the treehouse is higher than 2 metres, you will need a railing for. An elegant solution is to
                        use a wooden frame and rope, as I did for my <a href="gallery.html#balcony">balcony</a>.
                        Athough it can work out kind of expensive, I needed 100m of rope for this railing.

                    <h2>The Stairs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adding a <a href="gallery.html#stairs2">stairwell</a> will add some work, but will make it much
                        easier to use the treehouse in the long run. If you have to climb up and down each time
                        you want to use it, it will make you less likely to want to use it. If you are planning to build
                        a roof, this should be done first(after the floor), so that you can get up and down easily when
                        building the roof
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Walls and Roof</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you want to use your treehouse as a place for guests to sleep for example, then
                        you will need a <a href="gallery.html#roof">roof</a>, windows, doors. Windows will add a lot of
                        work, but are worthwhile, since
                        the advantage of being in a treehouse is the view. You can make part of the treehouse a balcony,
                        which
                        means you want need to cover the whole floor area.
                        I made my <a href="gallery.html#window">windows</a> entirely from scratch, which was a lot of
                        extra work, but allowed me to fit them exactly to the size of the treehouse,
                        and is also a lot more asthetically pleasing. I also made the balcony doors out of glass. The <a
                            href="gallery.html#entrance">entrance</a> doors were a lot simpler and made out
                        of lime wood, and was aslo very cheap to make.
                        You can use roofing felt as a cheap and easy way to waterproof the roof, but I went for
                        shingles, which are more expensive and more work to install,
                        but much nicer looking.
                        I am currently still working on the interior, but plan to install a bed. I have started
                        insulating the walls, although I am not planning to use it in winter,
                        as it is not much extra work, and I want to cover the wiring for the electricity(which is solar
                        powered).
