                <h2>Types of Treehousestest test</h2>

                <p>The first thing to consider when building a treehouse, is the scope and function.
                    A lot depends on the tree, and how much floor area you can realistically support.
                    The most basic type is a floor only, which is appropriate if you only want a childrens
                    playhouse. Depending on the height, you will need to consider a railing, and whether a Ladder
                    or stairs with a railing are necessary.
                    If you are ambitious, you might want to consider building a walls and a roof, which will
                    dramatically
                    increase the work involved. Then adding windows and door if you want to creat a guest house. All of
                    these steps involve exponentially more money and time.</p>

                    <h2>The Floor</h2>
                    <p>The exact size and dimensions of the platform will depend on the tree that you are building
                        the house in. While typical treehouse designs tend to use <a
                            href="gallery.html#support">supports at
                            45
                            degrees</a>
                        from the tree trunk, I used an unconventional design:
                        I cut of several trunks from a willow tree, and used the stumps as the support for my platform.
                        I used the the cut offtrunks as <a href="gallery.html#support2">pillars</a> to support the
                        extended
                        balcony.</p>
                    <p>If you are building a floor without a roof, then you should use decking and leave spaces between
                        the
                        boards for water to drain(as I did here for the balcony). For the indoor flooring I used tongue
                        and
                        groove boards.
                        If the treehouse is higher than 2 metres, you will need a railing for. An elegant solution is to
                        used
                        a wooden frame and rope, as I did for my balcony <a href="gallery.html#balcony">here</a>.
                        Athough it
                        can work out kind of expensive, I needed 100m of rope for this railing.

                    <h2>The Stairs</h2>
                    <p>
                        adding a stairwell will add some work, but will make it much more
                        easier to use the treehouse in the long run. If you have to climb up and down each time
                        you want to use it, it will make you less likely to want to use it. If you are planning to build
                        a roof, this should be done first, so that you can get up and down easily when building the roof

                    <h2>The Walls and Roof</h2>
                    If you want to use your treehouse as a place for guests to sleep for example, then
                    you will need a roof, walls, doors. Windows will add a lot of work, but are worthwhile, since
                    the advantage of being in a treehouse is the view. You can make part of the treehouse a balcony,
                    which
                    means you want need to cover the whole floor area.
